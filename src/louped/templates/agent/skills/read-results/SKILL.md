name: read-results
description: Read a louped run's results and report them honestly. Use after a run finishes, or when the person asks what a run or experiment found.
---

1. Find the run: call `runs` (filter by experiment), then `run <id>` for its metrics, parameters
   and files.
2. Read the files the run wrote:
   - Read `report.md` first, then the per-item records.
   - For an eval, `samples` and `sample` give each transcript and score.
   - The person changed the files named in the run's `louped.edited` tag after the run. When you
     quote them, say so.
3. Before any number, say what it rests on: the denominator, which items, which model revision.
   A rate on fewer than ~30 items is a pilot; say so.
4. Compare two runs only with `compare <a> <b>`. Report the difference with its paired interval
   and the run ids. Do not compare two runs on different items.
   - Within one run, `cohort` gives each condition's paired difference from the reference on any
     items. These can be the items the person picked (`ui_selection`'s `items/row/<id>` parts).
   - A run tagged `louped.cohort` ran on a cohort, not on every item. Say which.
5. Read examples, not only rates. From the records, name at least one item where the behavior
   happened and one where it did not. Check the scoring on them.
6. Separate what the result shows from what it suggests. Do not call a pilot result a finding.
   Do not infer intent from an answer.
7. Point the person to the run page (Items tab) for the rest. Write any report with
   `write-report`.
