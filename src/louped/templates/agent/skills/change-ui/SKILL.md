name: change-ui
description: Change what louped's pages show (reorder, hide, rename or explain any card, row, field, column or control; add text or a card; add a tab; pick a preset; set the theme; make a new figure or column from a run's files), and show the person parts of the app with a note. Use when the person asks to change a page or the look, refers to parts they picked in the app, or when an answer is clearer pointed at on screen.
---

1. Find what the person means:
   - For "this", "these", "that card", "here": call `ui_selection`. It lists the parts the person
     Shift+clicked, in order: pick 1 first, as the app's tray numbers them (`@sel 2` means pick 2).
     In Claude Code, new picks may already be in the message, from louped's prompt hook. Each part
     comes with:
     - its address (`items/row/28`, `items/stat/pressure`, `item/field/evidence/second_turn`,
       `run.overview/metric/accuracy`)
     - its page, run or experiment
     - its text
     - its `data`: an item's record under every condition, a condition's rate and flips, a
       field's value and meaning
   - Answer from that data first; it is what they see.
   - A reference the person pasted (`pick 1: louped part items/row/28 ...`) gives the same
     information.
2. Read the page with `ui_page` (with `experiment` for an experiment's page or its runs' pages).
   It gives:
   - each region's blocks and where they come from
   - the blocks each region can hold
   - the presets
   - the part rules in force (`parts`)
   - every kind of part by address, with the rules it takes
3. Pick the smallest change that does it, in this order:
   - A part (`set_part`): `hidden`, `label`, `about` (its ?), `note` (Markdown under it), `order`
     (among its siblings) and, for a control, `default` (its value when the URL sets none).
     `*` stands for any one name. For example, `item/field/*/abstain` hides abstain in every
     section, and `items/column/claim` hides one column. Names in addresses are URL-encoded.
   - A preset (`set_preset`): `eval` opens runs on their items, `training` puts curves first,
     `focus` keeps only numbers, report, items and files.
   - Reorder, drop, retitle or resize blocks in one region (`set_layout`). `title` renames a
     block or tab; `about` is its ?; `width` is `full`, `half` (two side by side) or `side`.
   - Add a built-in block: `metric` (`key`), `file` (`path`), as a block or its own tab,
     `figure` (`index`), `text` (`text`, Markdown) for a note.
   - Something the run's files hold but no page shows (points in 3D, an animation, a new column
     such as "x classified"): make it, then place it, in this order:
     - A new column on the items: `derive` with a script whose `derive(files)` returns rows
       keyed like the records (`qid`). It shows in Items as `<name>.<field>` and in the item's
       panel. Keep the script in `experiments/<name>/derive/` so it is committed.
     - A figure from one run: `derive` returning a figure, or `add_view` with `run_id` when you
       computed it yourself. It lands on the run's Figures tab (`figures/figure/views%2F<name>.json`).
       Use the `plotly` kind for 3D (`scatter3d`, `surface`) or `frames` (it plays them).
       When each mark is one of the run's items (a point per record), give the figure `items`
       (`{"folder": "<item folder>"}`; `"run"` too on an experiment's figure). Give each trace
       `ids` with the items' keys. For `vega`, give `items.field`, the data field that holds them.
       Then a hover on a mark names its item and source, a click opens it, and `trace` follows it.
     - A figure across runs of a question: `add_view` with `experiment`; it is kept in
       `experiments/<name>/views/` and shows on the experiment's page
       (`experiment/view/views%2F<name>.json`).
     - Panels that follow each other (a control or a click filters the rest, a live table, a
       diagram): a `board`. Its tables are inline rows or refs to a run's files, its metrics or
       its runs. Try it with `check_view` and fix every problem it names. Keep it with
       `add_view` (on a run or an experiment), or with `add_page` as a page in the sidebar
       (`/b/?name=<name>`). A panel is `board/<name>/panel/<id>`.
     - A page of its own only when it is a tool, not a figure or a board: a plugin (below).
     To change it later, call `add_view` or `derive` again with the same name. Look at it with
     `preview_view` first. Then `ui_show` the person to it with a one-line note. Keep data inline
     (no URLs). Give every figure an `about`.
     [figures.md](figures.md) has examples to copy: 3D points, animation, orbit, Vega-Lite params.
   - Only when nothing built in shows it, a `plugin` block (`plugin`, and `page` for a file in
     its `panel/`). Follow `add-plugin`, and build the page from the kit (step 5).
4. Scope:
   - A change for one experiment's pages goes in its layout (`experiment` set).
   - A change for every page goes in the project's layout.
   - A rule or region set to null is removed from the file.
5. Keep it louped's own:
   - One question a page. Prefer hiding, ordering and renaming to adding.
   - Little text: a note or `text` block is one or two sentences, not a manual. An `about` says
     how to read the part, in one sentence.
   - Never hide a denominator or an interval to make a difference look cleaner. A rate keeps its
     k/n and interval; a condition keeps its flips.
   - Numbers are `metric` cards or the kit's `stats`; never a sentence with a number in it.
   - A plugin page links `/kit/louped.css` and imports `/kit/louped.js`, and uses only their
     classes (`l-card`, `l-stats`, `l-table`, `l-button`, `l-muted`, `l-empty`) and helpers
     (`api`, `stats`, `table`, `h`, `empty`): no colors, fonts or shadows of its own.
   - The theme (`[theme]` in `louped.toml`) changes token values only: `radius`, and under
     `[theme.light]` and `[theme.dark]` the colors. `intervention` stays the one accent.
6. `set_part`, `set_layout` and `set_preset` check before they write, and the app shows the
   change at once.
   - Read `errors` in the answer. A file with errors is not used.
   - Tell the person what changed and where (`layout.json` or `experiments/<name>/layout.json`).
   - Tell them that the file is theirs to commit.
7. Show, don't describe. `ui_show` does these things:
   - It opens a page (`url`) and scrolls to parts by address.
   - It points at them (`highlight`, `spotlight` to dim the rest, or `pointer`), with a one- or
     two-sentence note beside the first.
   - It returns which parts were not on the page.

   Use it to put the evidence for an answer on screen, such as the item that flipped. If parts were
   missing, open the page that has them (an item's panel is `&item=<id>` on the Items tab). Then
   show again. Do not guess. Send one cue at a time: a newer one supersedes one the app is still
   looking for (status `superseded`).
